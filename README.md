# Used Cars
A Data Analysis Project.

## About Dataset
### Context:

Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale, yet it's very difficult to collect all of them in the same place. I built a scraper for a school project and expanded upon it later to create this dataset which includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.

### Content:

This data is scraped every few months, it contains most all relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales including columns like price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude, and 18 other categories. For ML projects, consider feature engineering on location columns such as long/lat. For previous listings, check older versions of the dataset.
